# 🤖 Line Solving Robot (Mini Project)

## 📘 Overview
This project presents a Line Solving Robot capable of following a predefined path using IR sensors and motor control logic. The system is built on a basic embedded platform and is designed to detect and follow black lines on a white surface, making it ideal for automated path navigation tasks.

## 🎯 Objective
To design and implement an intelligent robot that can autonomously detect and follow a black line using sensor input and motor control algorithms.

## 🧠 Features
- IR Sensor-based line detection
- Real-time decision making (left, right, straight)
- Embedded programming for motor control
- Efficient path following for curved and straight paths

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Arduino Uno
- IR Sensors (Array)
- DC Motors
- Motor Driver (L293D)
- Embedded C
- Power Supply Unit

## 🧪 Working Principle
The robot uses an array of IR sensors to detect the presence or absence of a black line. Depending on the sensor readings, the embedded logic controls the left and right motors using a motor driver to keep the robot aligned with the path.

## 🖼️ Applications
- Industrial path-following robots
- Automated delivery systems
- Educational robotic kits

## 🧑‍💻 Contributors
- Vikas S  
- Team Members (if any)

## 📅 Project Duration
- 1 Month (as part of the Mini Project requirement in ECE curriculum)
